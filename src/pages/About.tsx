        <p>
          Hi, I’m <strong>Hayden Poyfair</strong>, a dedicated and resilient developer with a passion for building meaningful, user-focused applications. Over the past few years, I worked full-time while attending UVU, independently funding my education without loans or family assistance. Balancing a demanding job as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) providing ABA therapy for children with autism — especially those with higher needs — taught me the value of patience, perseverance, and empathy.

          While this work deeply impacted me, it often left me drained and struggling to keep up with my academic responsibilities. But I’ve grown from those challenges. I transitioned into a less demanding job and enrolled in the University of Utah's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, where I’ve gained not only technical skills but also renewed confidence, time management, and discipline. I’m now more motivated than ever, supported by a partner who inspires me, and excited about building a career in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          With my bootcamp wrapping up and a fresh outlook, I’m committed to finishing my degree and pursuing opportunities that allow me to create, grow, and contribute. I’m especially excited to collaborate with other developers and continue learning as I move forward in my journey.
